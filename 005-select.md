# SELECT

As we briefly covered in the previous chapter, the `SELECT` statement allows us to retrieve data from a specific database.

You can use `SELECT` to get all of your users or a list of users that match a certian criteria.

Before we dive into the `SELECT` statemnt let's quickly create a database:

```
CREATE DATABASE sql_demo;
```

Switch to that database:

```
USE sql_demo;
```

Create a new users table:

```
CREATE TABLE users
(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    about TEXT,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    birthday DATE,
    active BOOL
);
```

Insert some data that we could work with:

```
INSERT INTO users
  ( username, email, active )
VALUES
  ('bobby', 'b@devdojo.com', true),
  ('devdojo', 'd@devdojo.com', false),
  ('tony', 't@devdojo.com', true);
```

Output:

```
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

We are going to lear more about the `INSERT` statement in the next chapters

## SELECT all columns

Now that we've got some data in the `users` table, let's go ahead and retrieve all of the entries from that table:

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Rundown of the statement:

* `SELECT`: first we specify the action that we want to execute, in our case we want to select or get some data from the database.
* `*`: the star here indicates that we want to get all of the columns associated with the table that we are selecting from.
* `FROM`: the from statement tells MySQL which table we want to select the data from. You need to keep in mind that you can select from multiple tables but this is a bit more advanced and we are going to cover this in the next few chapters
* `users`: this is the table name that we want to select the data from.

This will return all of the entries in the `users` table along with all of the columns:

```
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
| id | username | about | birthday | active | email         |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
|  1 | bobby    | NULL  | NULL     |      1 | b@devdojo.com |
|  2 | devdojo  | NULL  | NULL     |      0 | d@devdojo.com |
|  3 | tony     | NULL  | NULL     |      1 | t@devdojo.com |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

As you can see we get a list of the 3 users that we've just created including all of the columns in that table. In some cases the table might have a lot of columns and you might not want to see all of them, for example we have the `about` and `birthday` columns that are all `NULL` at the moment. Let's see how we could limit that and get only a list of specific columns.

## SELECT specific columns only

You could limit this to a specific set of columns, let's say that you only needed the `username` and the `active` columns. In this case you would change the `*` symbol with the columns that you wantto select devided by a comman:

```
SELECT username,active FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+--------+
| username | active |
+----------+--------+
| bobby    |      1 |
| devdojo  |      0 |
| tony     |      1 |
+----------+--------+
```

As you can see we are getting back only the 2 columns that we've specified in the `SELECT` statement.

## LIMIT

The `LIMIT` clause is very handy in case that you want to limit the number of results that you get back. For example at the moment we have 3 users in our database, but let's say that you only wanted to get 1 entry back when you run the `SELECT` statement.

This can be achieved by adding the `LIMIT` clause at the end of your statement followed by the number of entries that you want to get. Let's say that we wanted to get only 1 entry back, we would run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;
```

Output:

```
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
| id | username | about | birthday | active | email         |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
|  2 | bobby    | NULL  | NULL     |      1 | b@devdojo.com |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
```

If you wanted to get 2 entries you would change `LIMIT 2` and so on.

## COUNT

In case that you wanted to get only the number of entries in a specific column you could use the `COUNT` function. This is a function that I personally use very often.

The syntax is the following:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        3 |
+----------+
```

## DISTINCT

In some cases you might have duplicate entries in a table, and in order to get only the unique values you could use `DISTINCT`.

To better demonstrate this, let's run the insert statement one more time so that we could duplicate the existing users and have 6 users in the users table:

```
INSERT INTO users
  ( username, email, active )
VALUES
  ('bobby', 'b@devdojo.com', true),
  ('devdojo', 'd@devdojo.com', false),
  ('tony', 't@devdojo.com', true);
```

Now if you run `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;` you would get `6` back.

Let's also select all users and show only the `username` column:

```
SELECT username FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| username |
+----------+
| bobby    |
| devdojo  |
| tony     |
| bobby    |
| devdojo  |
| tony     |
+----------+
```

As you can see each name is present multiple times in the list. We have 2 times `bobby`, 2 times `devdjo` and 2 times `tony`.

If we wanted to only show the unique `usernames`, we could add the `DISTINCT` keyworkd to our select statement:

```
SELECT DISTINCT username FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| username |
+----------+
| bobby    |
| devdojo  |
| tony     |
+----------+
```

As you can see the duplicate entries have been removed from the output.
